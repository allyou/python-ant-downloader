	- merged branch 'multidevice': multi-device suppport
		- old known devices dbm is incompatable, you will need to repair
		- some configuration updated, tcx, raw, etc now write to path
		  which includes device serial number. It is recommended you
		  use latest configuration file. Update if you've copied it 
		  to ~/.antd.
		- pairing is only accepted when not running in daemon mode.
		  This seems to make sense because otherwise, the background
		  process would potentially drain battery of unparied devices
		  which are found in range.
		- updated antfs search code, can search for a device with specfic
		  serial numbers. prerequisites to implementing uploads.
